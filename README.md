  Note: Please ensure you have installed <code><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">nodejs</a></code>

  To preview and run the project on your device:
  1) Open project folder in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>
  2) In the terminal, run `npm install`
  3) Run `npm run dev` to view project in browser
